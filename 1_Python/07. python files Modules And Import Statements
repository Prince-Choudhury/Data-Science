file name - course_details.py

import os, sys
from os.path import dirname, join, abspath

sys.path.insert(0, abspath(join(dirname(__file__),'..')))

from payment import payment_details

def course():
    print("This is my course details")

payment_details.payment() 




another file name - payment_details.py
def payment():
    print("This is my payment details")
    
There are two files course_details and payment_details and we want to import payment_details
into course_details. So using above code we can perform this task.

Add these four line of code:

import os, sys
from os.path import dirname, join, abspath

sys.path.insert(0, abspath(join(dirname(__file__),'..')))

from payment import payment_details
